# M5510-4K-High-Sierra-Installation

This repository is based on darkhandz's high sierra repo for XPS15 9550.


The BIOS version for my laptop is 1.12.19, thus no need for OsxAptioFix2Drv-64.efi, sliding value calculations and the like.


This repo is far from complete. At the current stage:
What Works:
* Sound card (earplug not tested)
* Samsung SM951 works out of the box, no NVME kext needed.

What Doesn't Work:  
* Graphics, Intel HD530 with 4K, not even after Floris497's core display patch. 

Things that are not listed here have not been tested.
